# Ranking computer scientists or engeineers

"Landau genius scale" or "Landau's ranking" [[link](http://www.eoht.info/page/Landau%20genius%20scale)] is a ranking system of physicists maintained by Lev Landau.

In "The Essence of computing" by Wu Jun (Chinese, currnetly there's no English version yet),
Wu adopted similar concepts to ranking computer scientist or engineers by their impacts.

He ranked Donald E. Knuth as rank 1.

## Mini projects to try

Dataset that is small enough and already hosted on Kaggle, so that it is possible to leverage on Kaggle's free GPUs.

- Image classification with [Sports Image classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification)
- Car object detection with [Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection) dataset.
- Image Segmentation dataset:
    - [Coco Car Damage Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lplenka/coco-car-damage-detection-dataset/code)
    - [Medical Image Segmentation: Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/modaresimr/medical-image-segmentation): it seems interesting, but the scale is quite large
    - [Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset)
    - This scale of this dataset seems to be quite ideal
