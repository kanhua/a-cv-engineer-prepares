# A Computer Vision Engineer Prepares

I am trying to put together a list that in my opinion is essential to a computer vision engineer.

#### Digression on the title
(Chinese: 一個電腦視覺工程師的自我修養)
This title was come from "[An Actor Prepares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Actor_Prepares)".
Because of Steven Chu's movie "[King of Comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Comedy_(film)", this book title become well-known in Chinese culture zone.


Curated list of the learning resources of a computer vision engineer

# Ranking computer scientists or engeineers

"Landau genius scale" or "Landau's ranking" [[link](http://www.eoht.info/page/Landau%20genius%20scale)] is a ranking system of physicists maintained by Lev Landau.

In "The Essence of computing" by Wu Jun (Chinese, currnetly there's no English version yet),
Wu adopted similar concepts to ranking computer scientist or engineers by their impacts.

He ranked Donald E. Knuth as rank 1.


# Deep learning

## Concepts

#### Basics of machine learning

- Machine learning based classifier
- Regularization
- Stochastic Gradient Decent

#### Basic concepts of neural network

- Concepts neural networks
- Fully-connected layers
- Convolutional network
- Backpropogation

#### Architectures for solving the specific topics

- Well-known architectures: such as VGG or ResNet
- Image classfication
- Fine-tuning
- Object detection
- Image Segmentation

### Learning materials

- [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/schedule.html), University of Michigan
- [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/schedule.html), Stanford University
    - [Assignment 1](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2022/assignment1/)
    - [Assignment 2](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2022/assignment2/)
- [Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## Mini projects to try

Dataset that is small enough and already hosted on Kaggle, so that it is possible to leverage on Kaggle's free GPUs.

- Image classification with [Sports Image classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification)
- Car object detection with [Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection) dataset.
- Image Segmentation dataset:
    - [Coco Car Damage Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lplenka/coco-car-damage-detection-dataset/code)
    - [Medical Image Segmentation: Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/modaresimr/medical-image-segmentation): it seems interesting, but the scale is quite large
    - [Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset)
    - This scale of this dataset seems to be quite ideal (1578 files, 266.19 MB)

### Project rubrics

- Exploratory data analysis: what are the features of the dataset
- Problem: what is the definition of the problem?
- Your solution:
- Why did you choose this approach?
- Your implementation (code)
- Discussions
    - How does your solution perform?
    - How can you further improve the model?
